## Agenda
- Fill thesis form: TODO
	- Thesis Topic: Sea Ice Multiphase reactive transport + Coupled Sea Ice Multiphase  Biogeochemical Transport 

- Github Spyice Code
	- Access as collaborator? - Yes
	- Demo of code - No

- Model Map discussion- Yes

- Sea ice model by Vancoppenolle : https://www.nemo-ocean.eu/bibliography/how-to-cite/  - Sent link
## TODO: 
### Conference
- Adding new solver for liquid fraction
- Heat map for field variables, H_diff = H_0  -h_t
	- Calculate heatmap for different dz
	- Calculate heatmap over different iterations and dt
- Calculated the accumulated differences and compare with the final converged results (Temperature) with analytical model. 
- Mention the different mushy layer models and their issues. 
- Interactive presentations suggestions:
	- Quarto for interactive plots
	- gifs for plots
