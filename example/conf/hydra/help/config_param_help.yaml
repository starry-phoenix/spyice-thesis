  -- single run --
  To run the app use the following command:
  python main_config.py 

  -- multirun --
  You can use it in the multirun mode to run multiple configurations at once. 
  To run the app for a defined configuration by running with multirun -m flag.:
  1. python main_config.py -m consts=real dt=dt47 iter_max=iter_max1000 S_IC=S34
  This will generate outputs for defined constants, dt, iter_max and S_IC.
  
  You can also run the app for a defined dt to give outputs for the other configurations by running:
  2. python main_config.py -m dt=dt47

  Similarly, you can run the app for a defined dt and S_IC to give outputs for other defined iter_max by running:
  3. python config_param.py -m dt=dt47 S_IC=S34

  The default settings are:
