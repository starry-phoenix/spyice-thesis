SpyIce
======

The SPyIce package is a software tool that enables 1D finite difference simulation for vertical transport equations. It specifically focuses on thermal diffusion with the influence of salinity and physical properties. The package utilizes the Thomas tridiagonal solver as the solver algorithm. With SPyIce, users can model and analyze the behavior of temperature, salinity, and other relevant variables in a vertical system. It provides a comprehensive framework for studying the thermal diffusion process and its interaction with salinity in various scenarios. Hydra is used to automate the simulation runs of the Sea-Ice Model. It is used to manage and run sea ice simulations, making it easier for users to explore different scenarios and optimize their models.
